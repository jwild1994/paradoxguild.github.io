    We are a casual-serious/mid-core guild.<br><br>

    It's totally cool to shoot the shit during trash!<br><br>

    That being said, please respect the following rules to ensure a quick and smooth raid:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If at any point "Clear comms" is called, please just do not speak until we're out of combat. Only Main Tank (MT), Off-Tanks (OT), and Raid Lead (RL) should be speaking. No out-of-game speak when clear comms is called for, or bosses are initiated.
      </li>
      <li>
        When we are initiating a boss, DO NOT DPS until it is called for. If you wipe the raid because tanks have not positioned or gained enough threat, there will be a penalty. Likely leading with a warning, but repeated offenses will be addressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        As we are getting into more complicated raids, it should be expected that you at least come with a 5 stack of your primary consumes, some bandages/healing potions, and AT LEAST Onyxia+ZG Heart buff. Please ask for help if you need help with consumes. We can have guild events for fundraising or farming mats. If you are unsure on consumes to bring, ask in your class channels.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you sign up for a raid, or are automatically signed up for a raid (these will be posted every Wednesday), you need to mark if you will be absent or give us heads up. Do not sign up & no-show, you will incur a DKP penalty. Signups with the "Late" indicator are okay - life happens. Just make sure you attempt to show up. If we fill, we will let you know.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    We'd love to not enforce push-to-talk, and keep our cozy & casual vibe.<br><br>

    We'd also like to be clearing content in a respectable manner of time.<br><br>

    Let's kick ass & get some loot!
