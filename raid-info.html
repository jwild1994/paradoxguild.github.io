  <p class="font-xl font-center mb-md">Paradøx Raid Info</p>

  <p>To raid with Paradøx in 40 man content, you will need the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classic-loot-manager">Core Loot Manager Addon</a></p>
  <p>We will be having minimum bid on items, as to prevent certain classes with lesser counts for paying peanuts compared to a fair price on tier pieces and such.
    You can view the minimum DKP prices by visiting the <a href="/dkp.html">DKP Planner</a>!</p>
  <p>
    DKP Earned will be the following values:
    <ul class="mt-none">
      <li>Sign Up & No-Show/No Heads-up: -10 DKP</li>
      <li>On-Time to raids: 5 DKP</li>
      <li>MC: Bosses add up to 50 DKP</li>
      <li>BWL: Bosses add up to 100 DKP</li>
      <li>AQ40: Bosses add up to 150 DKP</li>
      <li>Naxx: 250 DKP</li>
      <li>Attending ZG/AQ20: 10 DKP (These will still be ran as SR raids)</li>
      <li>We would like to explore giving DKP for other things as well, like: blue/purple/orange parses, donating consumes (to a limit), farming LBRS venom sacks for AQ40, helping a guildie get a warlock/pally mount, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Tank HRs will still exist, but will require the tank to pay 3x the amount of DKP earned in the raid the item is dropped.
    This will also be far more limited than our SR system, in which the MT/OT got an HR on key items as well as 3xSR.
    This will instead be HRs ONLY on items that are BiS til the end of the game, or through the next 2 raids.
    <ul class="mt-none">
      <li>In MC, this is ONLY Band of Accuria and Onslaught Girdle (150 DKP each)</li>
      <li>In BWL, it is ONLY Drake Fang Talisman (300 DKP).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the cases of no bids, an item will be re-bid starting at 1 DKP. If the item is still not bid on, it will be DE'd.
  </p>
  <p>We will be using minimum bid increments of 5, please right click the CLM minimap icon, click "Configuration" and tick the checkbox for "Enable auto-update bid values". This will enable you to simply click MS or OS to up-bid someone.</p>
  <img src="/static/images/enable-auto-bid-updates.png" width="500">
  <p>The bidding window will look like the following, and as you can see, the bid amount incremented by 5 due to the checkbox being ticked:</p>

  <p>If you do not have enough DKP to up-bid, you CAN match the bid by entering the amount in the input box and pressing MS or OS.</p>
  <p>In the event of a tie, whoever has the highest "Roll" in the Roll column will receive the item.</p>
  <p>Lastly, you will also see a timer for remaining time to bid. It will increase by 10 seconds every time someone bids.</p>
